name: New format request
about: Request a new archival or compression format

---

<!--
This template is specifically for adding support for a new archive or compression format to the library. Please, precisely one format per issue.
To fill this out, replace these comments with your answers.
-->

## Introduce the format you are requesting.
<!-- What is it called, what is it used for, etc? Some background information. -->


## What do YOU use this format for?
<!-- We want to know YOUR specific use cases; why do YOU need this format? -->


## What is the format's conventional file extension(s)?
<!-- Don't overthink this one, it's a simple question. -->


## Please link to the format's formal or official specification(s).
<!-- If there isn't a formal spec, link to the most official documentation for the format. Note that unstandardized formats are less likely to be added unless it is in high-enough demand. -->


## Which Go libraries could be used to implement this format?
<!-- This project itself does not actually implement low-level format reading and writing algorithms, so link to pure-Go libraries that do. Dependencies that use cgo or invoke external commands are not eligible for this project. -->
